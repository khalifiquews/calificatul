## About
I'm khalifique and I typically work with python, C#, NodeJs and . I started learning how to code about 2018-19, when I was bored and didn't feel like writing an English essay. Since then, it's grown on me, as well as learning about how computers interact with others and how they work internally. Hopefully in the future, I can get into software development.


## Languages I know
* C#
* NodeJS
* Python

## Long term goals
* Learn C++/C
* Get a job as a backend software engineer
